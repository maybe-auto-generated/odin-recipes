    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This lasagna recipe takes a little work, but it is so satisfying and filling that it's worth it!</p>
    <p>Making lasagna can be time-consuming, but the results are well worth the wait. You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Shrimp: </strong>Choose large shrimp, peel and devein it yourself, or buy frozen. Thaw frozen shrimp before using.</li>
        <li><strong>Pasta: </strong>This recipe uses a 16-ounce package of linguine, but you can substitute angel hair pasta, fettuccine, or spaghetti.</li>
        <li><strong>Butter: </strong>Use unsalted butter. You can add salt to taste later in the recipe.</li>
        <li><strong>Extra-virgin olive oil: </strong>The flavor of the olive oil comes through in this recipe, so use the best quality.</li>
        <li><strong>Shallots and garlic: </strong>These aromatics add flavor and fragrance to shrimp scampi.</li>
        <li><strong>White wine: </strong>Use a dry, crisp white wine for shrimp scampi sauce. Chicken stock or white whine vinegar make great substitutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Lemon juice: </strong>Use freshly squeezed lemon juice for the best flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings: </strong>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper amplify the flavors, and a pinch of dried red pepper flakes to give a subtle kick</li>
        <li><strong>Parsley: </strong>Fresh parsley adds eye-catching color and a bright, peppery flavor</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prep ahead: </strong>Have all of your ingredients prepared and ready to cook before heating your skillet. You don't want to have to pause to cut, chop, squeeze, or measure right in the middle of a fast-moving recipe. If using fresh shrimp, you can peel and devein the shrimp early in the day, then chill it in the refrigerator until you're ready cook.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the pasta: </strong>Boil the pasta in well-salted water, drain, and hold aside before cooking the shrimp scampi. You'll add the pasta to the hot skillet to warm it before serving. Time your cooking so you're ready to start cooking the shrimp immediately after the pasta is drained; you don't want the pasta to sit for too long.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the shrimp: </strong>Cook and stir shallots, garlic, and red pepper flakes in the hot butter and oil until shallots are translucent. Season shrimp with kosher salt and black pepper then add to the skillet. Cook until pink then remove from the skillet and keep warm</li>
        <li><strong>Make the sauce: </strong>Pour white wine and lemon juice into skillet and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon.Melt 2 tablespoons butter in skillet, stir 2 tablespoons olive oil into butter mixture, and bring to a simmer.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the pasta: </strong>Toss linguine, shrimp, and parsley in the butter mixture until coated; season with salt and black pepper. Drizzle with 1 teaspoon olive oil to serve.</li>
